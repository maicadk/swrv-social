# SWRVSOCIAL 
### Live.Love.Choice


Swrv Social is a space to build a community of diverse thinkers, who need a mental escape through expression of sport, music, poetry, blogging, and other various art forms. The list will remain fluid, as we continue to evolve.

The tagline speaks to the values of the community.............
​
<p align="center">
Live everyday with purpose.
<p align="center">Love everyday unconditionally.
<p align="center">Choice is always yours.
</p>

<p align="center"><em>Quote of the Day</em></p>

<p align="center">What you think, you become. What you feel, you attract. What you imagine, you create.
